The dashboard enables dynamic filtering and comparison across various variables, offering valuable insights for decision-making.

### 4. Linear Regression with Python
**Code**: [Linear Regression with Python](https://github.com/OdessaZ/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20with%20Python.ipynb)

**Goal**: To understand and implement linear regression using Python, applying statistical learning concepts to analyze data and make predictions. It involved preprocessing data, building and evaluating a regression model, and visualizing results to gain insights.

**Description**: This project focuses on implementing linear regression in Python to explore the relationship between variables and make predictions. It begins with data preprocessing using libraries like Pandas and NumPy, then building and training a regression model with scikit-learn.
